            <h1>introduction</h1>
            <p>Alaina Mendoza is a third year studying visual communication design at San Francisco State University.
                Her interest in design piqued way back in middle school when she knew a web designer. From then on, all
                things design were in and of her interest. Things like interior design, graphic design, and even a
                little bit of fashion design. Doing things like making school yearbook pages, video editing for
                yearbook, and taking art class has paved her way to where she is right now.

                Alaina has always been surrounded by music; it’s a major part of her life. From singing since birth,
                taking piano and violin lessons, to teaching herself guitar, music is one of the biggest inspirations to
                her creativity. Her experience in church choir, violin concerts, and gig performances allow her to see
                music in a different light. To her, music isn’t just the sound but also the visuals and the
                storytelling. It inspires her to create things like music posters, album covers, CD labels, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
                In her free time, she enjoys practicing film photography, video editing, reading, making song covers,
                and eating burgers! Her wallet hates to see these things coming though..
